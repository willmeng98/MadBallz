# MadBallz
A game I made with processing during my freshman year of high school. 
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible while preventing the moving ball from touching the bottom of the screen.
The player can move his paddle left and right with the cursor. 
The player has 5 lives.

Good luck and have fun!
